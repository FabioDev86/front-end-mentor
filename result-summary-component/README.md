## Getting Started

# Basic structure:

I will make two macro components: Result and Summary
Putting them in a flex div should be enough for responsiveness. 

# Result:
An h1 at the top "Your result"

A div with the result calculated from the json

Another h1 with comment about the result   

A p for the final text
